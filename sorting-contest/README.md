## Sorting Contest

Tested Algorithms: **Selection Sort**, **Quick Sort**
* This project explores different approaches to finding the most efficient sorting strategy for rule sampling.
* The goal is to select the top **k** elements from a larger list (specifically, 20 out of 120 samples).
* The tested approaches showed equivalent performance based on the evaluation results.
